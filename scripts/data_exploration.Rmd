# Data Exploration

```{R}
# Read Data
filepath <- "~/Documents/School/BIOS511/Project/data/owner_change.csv"
owner_change <- read_csv(filepath)

project_directory <- "~/Documents/School/BIOS511/Project"
hospital_info_path <- "/data/HOSPITAL_INFO.csv"
hospital_info <- read_csv(paste(project_directory, hospital_info_path, sep = ""))
```

```{R}
# Histogram
ggplot(owner_change, aes(x = `EFFECTIVE DATE`)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 30, color = "black", fill = "lightblue") +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Effective Dates", x = "Effective Date", y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{R}
# Link Data
hospital_changes <-
  left_join(
    owner_change %>% select(
      "CCN - BUYER",
      "CCN - SELLER",
      "ORGANIZATION NAME - BUYER",
      "ORGANIZATION NAME - SELLER",
      "EFFECTIVE DATE"
    ),
    hospital_info %>% select(
      "Facility ID",
      "Facility Name"
    ),
    by = c("CCN - BUYER" = "Facility ID")
  ) %>%
  left_join(
    hospital_info %>% select(
      "Facility ID",
      "Facility Name"
    ),
    by = c("CCN - SELLER" = "Facility ID")
  ) %>%
  # Renaming the Redundant Columns
  rename(
    "Facility Name - Buyer" = "Facility Name.x",
    "Facility Name - Seller" = "Facility Name.y"
  )
```

Let's make sure that we have a proportional sample throughout time. Once we filter out all _incomplete data_ - owner changes without buyer _and_ seller information - is our data missing at random? The following figure appears to support this claim. 

```{R}
hospital_changes %>%
  # Add Temporary Label for Complete Data: Existing Buyer/Seller Info
  mutate(complete = case_when(
    is.na(`Facility Name - Buyer`) |
      is.na(`Facility Name - Seller`) ~ "Missing",
    TRUE ~ "Complete"
  )) %>%
  mutate(complete = factor(complete, levels = c("Missing", "Complete"))) %>%
  # Plot Histogram
  ggplot(
    aes(
      x = `EFFECTIVE DATE`,
      fill = complete,
    )
  ) +
  geom_histogram(
    binwidth = 30,
    color = "black",
    alpha = 0.5,
    position = "stack"
  ) +

  # Set Legend
  scale_fill_manual(
    name = "Data Completeness",
    values = c("Complete" = "red", "Missing" = "gray"),
    labels = c("Complete" = "Complete Data", "Missing" = "Missing Data")
  ) +

  # Additional aesthetics
  labs(
    title = "Hospital Changes Histogram",
    x = "Effective Date",
    y = "Count"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```
